Data 534 Project – Personal Log

Feb 14: Initial group meetings/discussions
-	Met as a group and explored and discussed some possible APIs for usage
-	Explored a few that looked useful together
-	Decided on two that looked promising and Neethu emailed to professor
-	While waiting on response, continued searching APIs
-	Later decided on country-based API together that looked promising
-	Discussed pulling and exploring some of the data on our own and reconvening later to discuss
-	During my personal exploration of data returned, I realized that on free tier very limited useful information was returned from API calls (would be difficult to graph/visualize)
-	Switched personal efforts to finding a different API
-	Discussed concerns with group who agreed to move in another direction
-	Continued to search for interesting APIs through Rapid API, but also discovered that free tier was limited to 1 request per day which was not useful
-	Explained this to teammates who agreed they did not wish to pay
-	After more research, group reconvened to pitch ideas
-	Ultimately, I found and pitched [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/?version=latest#c33f57dd-3bb3-3b1f-c454-08cab413a115)
-	group agreed to move forward with
-	Agreed to discuss more at school next day

Feb 15: Moving forward with API
-	Met briefly at school, decided that zoom meeting later was preferred
-	Attended zoom meeting with team at 4-5pm
-	Group [git repo created](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/?version=latest#c33f57dd-3bb3-3b1f-c454-08cab413a115)
-	Decided to work on Git via forked repo requests
-	Teammates attended another meeting from 5-6
-	Used this time to create some basic functions to retrieve useful data from API
-	Pushed [base functions](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/be196b084064ae70ca72322af3b24ac680ba9291)
-	Reconvened at 630 to show functions and discuss next steps
-	Suggested a “top 10 deals” approach as being useful information for consumers 
-	Agreed at close of meeting, teammates would continue working on functions and to create some meaningful viz
-	Planned to reconvene later 9PM, but later decided as group to push to next day

Feb 16:  Discussion and documentation 
-	Met and discussed progress and changes in person (on campus)
-	Reviewed changes that teammates had made to [file/functions](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/04d11e7f185c27d31d154ad0fead28848e972b70)
-	Teammates created a “driver function”/application called response()
      o	accepts user inputs and can call on all the various API wrapper functions
      o	retrieves data and transform it into a useful graph for users
-	Although not necessary per se in terms of the specific project deliverables, decided we wanted to try to keep the function as it shows functionality of package and delivers start to finish useful information for consumers
-	Added some [docstring information and one visualization](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/be196b084064ae70ca72322af3b24ac680ba9291)
-	Supported work on unit testing/package creation efforts by teammates (google/stack searches)
-	Mostly focused on understanding documentation requirements
-	Researched/viewed popular R packages for example vignettes (dyplr, lubridate, testhat) to see examples of how vignettes are styled 
-	Wrote a base description in plain English for each function to serve as base for [vignette](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/e08c938c9538a145f23f5ec09ff25f297da9c782)
-	Explained to teammates would not be able to work on project on Thursday due to other commitments

Feb 17:  No contributions from me on this day 
-	Received slack message that Neethu had added code of conduct and added lines of code to test for correct user inputs
-	Requested to do a git pull to get up to date

Feb 18:  More documentation
-	Met with teammates briefly in AM, both called into work 1-9PM
-	Agreed I would review project rubric added to Canvas and inventory our project to date 
-	Brought personal fork up to date and reviewed new material added by teammates
-	Based on rubric, decided to focus my efforts for the afternoon on expanding vignette documentation (50 marks) as easily accomplished without distributing base code in absence of discussion with partners
-	Also updated visualizations in response() function to add labels and reorder outputs
-	Started ReadMe file for project with some basic info
- Met with partners in evening and updated them on progress
- pushed [3 files with changes to my fork and created pull requests](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/abb86d100114e6b699ce523e6d8655d5e03dde5e)
- moved contents of [personal log file to markdown](https://github.com/DishaDH123/pcgamedeals/commit/1b2c6b9bb966f9de5d2f814520e9c9c8d06dd987)

Feb 19: 
- recieved slack message github actions was a success and request to refork 
- Reforked as requested (unsure what happened to previous fork? I can still see the repo but no longer connected to main?!?)
- Added in links to log file to key commits made by me as required by rubric
