## General Workflow:
* The team will be having regular meetings over zoom or in person to clearly discuss the outcomes of the project and to successfully achieve the same.
* The work will be equally divided between the team members and each will work on the tasks within the deadline.
* All team members will work as a team and explain each others work clearly and have clear motives.

## Git Workflow:
* All team members have agreed to use the fork method in git to contribute into the main repository. 
* One main github repository has been created the other two members will fork the repository.
* Each member can use this forked repository for all the changes done during the course of the project by him/her.
* Each team member will create pull requests once they have made changes to the repository.
* The pull requests are created when each member reaches a reasonable checkpoint in the work done.
* The pull request is merged with the main repository after having a discussion over the changes made.
* No undesirable changes will be made directly to the main repository unless the team meets and discusses about the changes.
