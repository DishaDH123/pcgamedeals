## Data 534 Project – Personal Log ##

#### Feb 14th : Initial group meetings/discussions ####

- Met as a group and explored and discussed some possible APIs for usage
- Explored a few that looked useful together
- I emailed professor Yves asking his approval to choose the API.
- Continued our search until we got a response from professor Yves.
- We decided on country based API ,which was good and returned good amount of data but we considered the scenario wherein most of our data was categorical and hence we couldn’t possibly plot them Hence we continued our search for other APIs,
- Another API which I found was words API which returned a word complete meaning its synonyms and antonyms, didn’t know how to respond with this either hence moved on,
- Continued our search for API, Kristy provided us with Rapid API link got into exploring that 
- But was informed by her that we need to pay for the usage , hence dropped the idea.
- Ultimately Kristy found the API Cheapshark which is a API which provides game deals and store information along with many other attributes.
- Decided to discuss futher again in class the following day.

#### Feb 15th : Moving forward with the API ####

- Met briefly at school, decided that zoom meeting later was preferred
- Attended zoom meeting with team at 4-5pm
- Disha created the repo , Me and Kristy forked the repo.
- Me and Disha had to jump on another workshop Kristy continued with the work.
- Kristy created base functions and pushed them to the repo.
- We gathered again at 6.30 to discuss progress, Kristy explained her base functions and possible plots for our API.
- Agreed at close of meeting, teammates would continue working on functions and to create some meaningful viz
- Created the main function  response() which would take user input and give user options to see the results in plot. [Main function](https://github.com/Neetz78/pcgamedeals-1/tree/aa08ddac87cc215a75b930c24eb906457517609b)
- Created another wrapper function get_deals_by_store() [wrapper function for deals by store](https://github.com/Neetz78/pcgamedeals-1/tree/7b90f8006c9210bd484e2186e511f51105446b21)

#### Feb 16th : Discussion and documentation ####

- Met and discussed progress and changes in person (on campus)
- Reviewed changes that teammates had made to file/functions
- Kristy worked on adding the docstring and visualization for the first wrapper function.
- Disha was working on adding docstring for remaining functions, I watched a video and researched on how to create a R package and got the environment ready to create our package.
- Once Kristy and Disha were ready we merged and pulled and updated all our repos to match the main,
- I created the package in the R studio, ran in numerous errors took help from my team mates to find answers from google and stack overflow.
- After many attempts package was created and I pushed it to my repo and then created a pull request to merge with the main.[Package created](https://github.com/Neetz78/pcgamedeals-1/tree/590cb4a443b16cda94cb3088ee82b7c866695eaa)
- Once done with this , we decided that Disha would work on test cases and Kristy would get the vignette documentation done.
- Decided to reconvene tomorrow in college.
